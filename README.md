The world's first digital good luck charm,
which houses spirits invisible to the eye,
the "spacer.gif good luck charm", has been developed.

On this website,
we sell spacer.gif,
the world's first "digital good luck charm" that was 
invented upon the dawn of the Internet
it is infused with spirits and prayer through a special ceremony,
to protect its owner.

After approximately 25 years since the world's first website was established,
the grand invention of the spacer.gif
currently has come to be regarded as a kludge,
and has been cast out.

Modern websites are not limited to simple perusal,
and have become portals of communication
between unseen people and entities.
And with new modes of communication,
come new dangers.

Dating sites, phishing frauds,
identity thefts, and click frauds are just some examples.

By bestowing ceremony and story upon the spacer.gif,
we deify this great innovation
which has accorded great influence on the Internet,
and it is now in need of re-invention as a talisman for these modern times.

And so now, the spacer.gif
comes to us, from the great beyond of the Internet,
through the memory chips of smartphones,
across the enormous information network,
to once again burn hot and silently,
within the hearts of each and every one of us,
and continue to render ubiquitously.
